=============

A collection of mini development keyboards for Project Obluda.

I will eventually make this into a reference repository for my upcoming beginner-friendly blog mini-series about my journey to build your first keyboard *from scratch* using ZMK (Zephyr Mechanical Keyboard) firmware, which was built on the Zephyrâ„¢ Project Real Time Operating System (RTOS).

There are already plenty of keyboard building guides online, but none had all most of what I needed to know when I first started. I hope this will be of some use, along with other existing guides, to complete beginners to the world of custom keyboards, embedded systems and electronics.
